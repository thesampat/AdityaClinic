Understanding Degenerative Changes

What are Degenerative Changes?

Degenerative changes are basically the normal wear and tear our bodies go through over time, kind of like how a well-used car might show signs of age. Our bones, joints, discs, and other tissues can change as we get older.

These changes might mean our spinal discs thin out or dry up, we develop bone spurs, or our joint cartilage wears down. While this is all natural, it can lead to issues like osteoarthritis or degenerative disc disease, which cause things like pain, stiffness, and trouble moving in those areas.

While we can't reverse these changes completely, we can manage them. Doing exercises to keep our muscles strong, staying at a healthy weight, sitting and standing with good posture, and getting medical help if we have ongoing pain or stiffness can all help us keep moving well as we grow older.
