what is Corn ?

Corns are like tiny tough patches that can pop up on your feet or hands when they face a lot of rubbing or pressure. They might feel like a small bump or a hardened spot and can sometimes hurt, especially when you're walking or using your hands a lot.

They usually show up in areas that get a lot of action, like your feet when you wear tight shoes or your hands when you grip things tightly. While they're not usually a big problem, they can be annoying, especially if they press on sensitive spots or keep rubbing.

To deal with corns, it's good to wear comfy shoes, maybe use some soft pads or cushions for protection, and keep your feet clean and cozy. Homeopathy has some natural tricks up its sleeve too, which can ease the pain, reduce any swelling, and stop corns from coming back by taking care of what's causing them in the first place.
