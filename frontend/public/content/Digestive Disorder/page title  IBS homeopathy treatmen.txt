what is IBS?

IBS, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, is a digestive disorder that affects the large intestine, causing symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. It's a chronic condition that can vary in severity and can significantly impact a person's quality of life. While the exact cause of IBS is not fully understood, factors such as diet, stress, and changes in gut bacteria may play a role. Treatment for IBS typically focuses on managing symptoms through dietary changes, stress management, medication, and in some cases, complementary therapies like homeopathy.
