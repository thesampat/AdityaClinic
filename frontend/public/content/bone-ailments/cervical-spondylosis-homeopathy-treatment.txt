                    <h3 class="text-body fst-italic mb-4">What is Cervical Spondylosis?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Cervical spondylosis, also known as neck arthritis, is a common condition that affects the neck's cervical spine. As we age, the discs and vertebrae in our neck can undergo wear and tear, leading to various symptoms. These can include neck pain, stiffness, headaches, and sometimes tingling or numbness in our arms or hands.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">This condition can happen due to different reasons, like poor posture, injuries, or even our genes. Over time, this wear and tear can cause bone spurs, herniated discs, or a narrowing of the spinal canal.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Managing cervical spondylosis involves a mix of strategies. Taking pain-relief medications, both over-the-counter and prescribed, can help ease discomfort. Engaging in physical therapy and specific exercises can strengthen neck muscles and boost flexibility. It's also crucial to make lifestyle changes such as keeping a healthy weight, using ergonomic setups at work, and practicing good posture in everyday activities.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">By combining these approaches and staying in touch with healthcare providers, we can effectively manage cervical spondylosis and improve our neck health.</p>
