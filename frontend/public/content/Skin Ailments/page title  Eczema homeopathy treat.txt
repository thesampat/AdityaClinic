what is Eczema?

Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is a skin issue causing red, itchy, and inflamed patches that can be dry, scaly, or even ooze at times. It affects people of all ages and tends to flare up due to triggers like allergens, irritants, climate changes, stress, or hormonal shifts. Managing eczema involves regular moisturizing to prevent dryness and itchiness, avoiding triggers, using gentle skincare products, and sometimes medications like steroids or antihistamines.

Homeopathy provides a natural approach to eczema care. It tailors remedies to an individual's symptoms and health, aiming not just to relieve symptoms but also to tackle the root causes of flare-ups. These treatments are gentle, safe, and can complement conventional eczema therapies effectively.
