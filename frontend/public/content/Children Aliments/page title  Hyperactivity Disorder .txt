what is Hyperactivity Disorder?

Hyperactivity Disorder, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is a condition that affects both children and adults, causing difficulties with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. People with ADHD may struggle to focus on tasks, have trouble sitting still, and act impulsively without thinking through consequences. It can impact various aspects of life, including school or work performance and social interactions. However, with proper diagnosis and management, individuals with ADHD can learn strategies to cope with their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives. Treatment options such as therapy, lifestyle changes, and sometimes medications like those in homeopathy can help manage ADHD symptoms effectively.
