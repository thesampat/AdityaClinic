what is Cracks on Heels?

Cracks on heels, also known as heel fissures, are those pesky splits or openings that form on the skin of our heels. They often pop up because our heels get dry or from standing or walking too much, especially in open-back shoes. These cracks can vary from minor little lines to deep gaps that might hurt or even bleed. Things like living in a dry area, not keeping our feet moisturized, or certain health issues can make them worse. These cracks aren't just about looksâ€”they can make our heels feel sore, cause pain, and if we don't treat them, they might even lead to infections.
