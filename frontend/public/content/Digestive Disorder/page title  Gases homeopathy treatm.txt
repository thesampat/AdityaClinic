what is Gases?

"Gases" typically refers to excessive air or bloating in the digestive system, causing discomfort and sometimes leading to flatulence. This condition often arises from factors like diet, lifestyle habits, or underlying digestive issues. When we eat or drink, we swallow air along with food and liquids. This air can get trapped in the digestive tract, leading to bloating, burping, or passing gas. Certain foods, carbonated drinks, eating too quickly, or stress can exacerbate this problem. Addressing these factors and promoting better digestion can help manage and reduce excessive gases.
