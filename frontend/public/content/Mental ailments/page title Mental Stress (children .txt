what is Mental Stress (children & adults)?

Mental stress, whether in kids or grown-ups, is all about feeling strained emotionally and mentally. This can happen because of a bunch of reasons like having a lot of work or school tasks, dealing with family problems, facing challenges with friends, or going through personal issues. It's like our minds get overloaded and we start feeling anxious, worried, moody, or even sad.

For children, this stress often comes from things like school pressure, making friends, or changes in their family life. Adults, on the other hand, feel stressed due to work demands, money matters, relationships, or societal expectations. The key is to realize that mental stress is quite common and can affect anyone, influencing how we feel and act in our daily lives.
