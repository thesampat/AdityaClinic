Page title : Dandruff homeopathy treatment?

what is Dandruff ?

Dandruff is something most of us have dealt with—it's those pesky white or yellowish flakes that appear in our hair and on our shoulders. These flakes are just dead skin cells from our scalp. While dandruff isn't harmful, it can be annoying, itchy, and embarrassing.

Several factors can cause dandruff, like having dry or oily skin, being sensitive to certain hair products, or having a fungus called Malassezia on our scalp. When these factors are off balance, they cause more skin cells to grow, leading to dandruff.

To manage dandruff, special shampoos and treatments target these root causes—like controlling oiliness, keeping your scalp moisturized, or fighting fungal growth. Plus, keeping your scalp clean and healthy helps prevent dandruff from coming back.
