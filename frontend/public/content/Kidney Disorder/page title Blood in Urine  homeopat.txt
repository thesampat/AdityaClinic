what is Blood in Urine?

Seeing blood in your urine, which doctors call hematuria, means noticing shades of red, pink, or brown in your pee because of red blood cells. It's like your body raising a red flag, signaling that there might be something going on in your urinary system. This could be caused by things like infections, kidney stones, or even intense workouts. While sometimes it's not a big worry, other times it might point to something more serious like kidney problems or bladder issues. It's really important to talk to a doctor about it so they can find out the cause and recommend the right treatment for you.
