what is Obesity (Overweight) ?

Obesity, or being overweight, happens when your body stores too much fat. This can cause various health issues, not just affecting your appearance but also how your body works. Genetics, diet, how active you are, and your lifestyle all play a part in obesity. When you eat more calories than your body needs, the extra calories turn into fat. This buildup of fat can lead to serious problems like heart disease, diabetes, and joint issues over time. Managing obesity means eating healthy, staying active with exercise, and sometimes, getting medical help to reach a healthy weight for your body.
