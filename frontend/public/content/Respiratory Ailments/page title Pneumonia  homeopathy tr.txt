Pneumonia is like a battleground inside your lungs! It's when air sacs in your lungs get filled with fluid or pus due to an infection. This can make it hard to breathe and cause symptoms like coughing, chest pain, fever, and fatigue. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and it often happens after a cold or flu. It can affect anyone, but it's more serious for young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, rest, and plenty of fluids to help your body fight off the infection and recover.
