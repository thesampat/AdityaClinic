what is Kidney disease?

Kidney disease occurs when your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood effectively. Think of your kidneys as filters that remove waste and extra fluid from your blood, helping maintain a healthy balance in your body. When they're not working well, waste builds up, causing various health issues. Kidney disease can develop from high blood pressure, diabetes, infections, or other factors. Symptoms may include fatigue, swelling, trouble sleeping, and changes in urination. Treatment involves managing underlying conditions, adopting a kidney-friendly diet, medications, and sometimes dialysis or kidney transplant for severe cases. Regular check-ups are crucial for kidney health.
