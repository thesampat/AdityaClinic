what is Food Poisoning?

Food poisoning happens when you eat food or drink water that's contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins. This contamination can occur during food preparation, handling, or storage. Symptoms can range from stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and fatigue. It's usually a temporary illness, but severe cases may require medical attention. Good hygiene, proper cooking and storage of food, and avoiding risky foods or drinks can help prevent food poisoning. If you suspect food poisoning, it's important to stay hydrated and seek medical advice if symptoms are severe or persistent.
