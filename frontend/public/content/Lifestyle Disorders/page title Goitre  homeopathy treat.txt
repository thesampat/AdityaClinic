what is Goitre?

Goitre is like a little sign your body shows when your thyroid gland needs a check-up. This gland, located in your neck, is super important for keeping your metabolism in balance with its hormones. Sometimes, it can swell up and cause a visible lump in your neck area. This usually happens if you're not getting enough iodine in your diet or if there are issues with your thyroid. Even though it's often painless and doesn't bother you much, it's good to get it looked at because it might hint at a thyroid problem that needs some attention and care.
