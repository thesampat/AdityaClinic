what is Burning in Urine?

Burning in urine, also known as dysuria, is when you feel an uncomfortable stinging or burning sensation when you pee. It's like a little alarm bell from your body telling you something's off in your urinary system. This sensation can happen for a few reasons, like having a urinary tract infection (UTI), eating foods that irritate your system, dealing with kidney stones, or having inflammation in your urinary system.

While it's not usually a serious issue, it can be quite bothersome. It's essential to pay attention, especially if it sticks around or comes with other symptoms like needing to pee often or having cloudy urine. These signs might mean there's a bigger problem that needs checking out.
