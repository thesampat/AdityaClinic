what is High / Low BP?

High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the force of blood pushing against your artery walls is consistently too high. It's like having a bit too much pressure in a water hoseâ€”it strains your heart and blood vessels over time. This strain can lead to serious issues like heart disease, stroke, and problems with your kidneys. On the flip side, low blood pressure, or hypotension, is when that pressure is too low, which can make you feel dizzy or faint. Both high and low BP are important to keep an eye on because they can affect your overall health. Regularly checking your BP and talking to a doctor if you notice any changes is crucial for staying healthy.
