what is Allergies[Recurrent cough and cold]?

Allergies that cause recurrent cough and cold are your body's way of reacting too much to harmless things around you. Imagine your immune system as a security guard—it sometimes gets too cautious and thinks everyday things like dust or pollen are dangerous intruders. So, it starts this defense mode, leading to symptoms like coughing, sneezing, and a stuffy or runny nose. These reactions can happen often, especially when you're near things like pet dander or certain foods that trigger your allergies. It's like your body's sensitive alarm system, making you feel uncomfortable and disrupting your daily routine.
