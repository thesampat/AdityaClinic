what is Bronchitis?

Bronchitis is when your lungs feel really irritated and inflamed, making you cough a lot and produce more mucus. It can feel like your lungs are throwing a little tantrum! This irritation often happens because of infections like colds or exposure to things like smoke or pollution. While it can clear up on its own with some rest and fluids, sometimes it needs a little extra help. That's when seeing a doctor comes in handy! They can give you advice on how to ease the discomfort and breathe better while your body works on getting back to normal.
