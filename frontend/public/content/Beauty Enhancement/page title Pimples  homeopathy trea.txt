what is Pimples?

Pimples aren't just caused by things like oil and bacteriaâ€”they can also pop up because of daily habits like what we eat, how we sleep, and how stressed we are. Hormonal changes, especially during big life events like puberty or pregnancy, can also cause our skin to get oilier, leading to more pimples.

Taking care of pimples means doing things like washing our face regularly with gentle products, avoiding rough treatments, and not touching our face too much to keep bacteria away. Homeopathy looks at everything that might be causing pimples, like our skin type, hormones, and overall health, to give us treatments that are just right for us. These treatments help calm down redness, keep oil in check, and support our skin's natural health, so we can say bye-bye to pimples the natural way!
