what is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a condition where your body has trouble managing blood sugar levels. Normally, after we eat, our body breaks down food into glucose, a type of sugar. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps glucose enter our cells to provide energy. In diabetes, either the pancreas doesn't make enough insulin (Type 1) or the body can't use insulin properly (Type 2). This leads to high blood sugar levels, causing symptoms like thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and slow wound healing. Managing diabetes involves medications, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and regular monitoring to keep blood sugar levels in check.
