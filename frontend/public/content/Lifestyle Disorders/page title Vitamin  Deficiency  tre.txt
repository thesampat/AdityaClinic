what is Vitamin  Deficiency?

Vitamin deficiency happens when our bodies miss out on the important vitamins we need to stay healthy. These vitamins, like A, B, C, D, E, and K, do a lot of essential jobs in our bodies, from keeping our immune system strong to helping our bones stay sturdy and our skin look good. When we don't get enough of these vitamins because of things like not eating right, having certain health issues, or not taking care of ourselves, it can cause problems. For example, not having enough Vitamin D can make our bones weaker, and not having enough Vitamin C can make it easier for us to get sick. Eating a good mix of fruits, veggies, and other healthy foods is key to making sure we don't miss out on these vitamins and stay healthy overall.
