what is Bed Wetting, Concentration Difficulties?

Bed wetting, also called nocturnal enuresis, is when a person involuntarily urinates during sleep, most commonly seen in children. It's a natural part of growing up for many kids and often resolves with time. Concentration difficulties, on the other hand, refer to struggles in focusing, paying attention, and staying engaged. This can affect learning, school performance, and daily tasks. Both bed wetting and concentration difficulties are common issues, especially among children, and can sometimes be linked to underlying factors like stress, anxiety, or physical conditions. Seeking support and understanding can help manage these challenges effectively.
