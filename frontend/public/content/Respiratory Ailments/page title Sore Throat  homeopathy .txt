what is Sore Throat ?

A sore throat is your body's way of letting you know that your throat is feeling uncomfortable. It can feel scratchy, hurt when you swallow, or just feel irritated. There are a few reasons why you might get a sore throat, like catching a cold with a virus, getting a bacterial infection like strep throat, having allergies, or even being in dry air with lots of dust or pollution. Sometimes, talking loudly or singing for a while can also make your throat sore. Usually, a sore throat goes away on its own with some rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and using soothing remedies.
