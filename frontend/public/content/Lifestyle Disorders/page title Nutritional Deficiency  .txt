what is Nutritional Deficiency?

Nutritional deficiency happens when your body doesn't get all the important nutrients it needs to stay healthy. These nutrients, like vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fats, are like fuel for your body to work well. If you don't eat enough of these nutrients or your body can't use them properly, it can lead to health issues.

For example, not having sufficient iron can make you tired and weak, a condition known as anemia. Low vitamin D levels can make your bones weak and make it harder for your body to fight off illnesses. Inadequate vitamin C intake can cause problems like swollen gums and bruising easily, known as scurvy.

Nutritional deficiencies can happen due to not eating a balanced diet, having certain health conditions, or lifestyle habits. To avoid these problems, it's important to eat a variety of healthy foods to give your body what it needs to function well and keep you feeling your best.
