page title: DNS homeopathy treatment?

what is DNS?

DNS, or Deviated Nasal Septum, happens when the inner wall of your nose isn't straightâ€”it's like a little bend in your nose's pathway. Normally, this wall divides your nose evenly, but in DNS, one side becomes narrower. This can cause issues like congestion, trouble breathing through one nostril, and even make you more prone to sinus problems and snoring. While it's not usually a big problem, it can make daily life less comfortable, especially if it affects your sleep or breathing. Fixing it can often bring relief and improve your overall well-being.
