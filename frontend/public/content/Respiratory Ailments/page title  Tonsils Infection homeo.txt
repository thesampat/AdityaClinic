what is Tonsils Infection?

Tonsillitis, or a tonsils infection, occurs when the tonsils, those small glands at the back of your throat, become inflamed due to viruses or bacteria. It's like your throat's defense mechanism kicking in! This condition often shows up with symptoms like a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever, and sometimes swollen neck glands. It can affect anyone, especially children, and while it can be uncomfortable, it often gets better on its own or with basic treatments. However, in severe or recurring cases, it's important to seek medical attention to prevent complications and ensure a speedy recovery.
