what is UTI ?

A UTI, short for Urinary Tract Infection, is when pesky bacteria sneak into your urinary system, which is like a network of pipes that carry urine in and out of your body. Imagine it's like a little invasion where these bacteria cause a bit of chaos.

When you have a UTI, you might feel like you need to pee more often than usual, and it can sting or hurt when you do. Your pee might also look cloudy or smell weird, and sometimes, you might feel a bit of discomfort in your lower belly or back.

It's not a pleasant experience, but the good news is that UTIs can usually be treated with the right kind of care, like drinking plenty of water, taking medication prescribed by a doctor, and sometimes making a few lifestyle adjustments.
