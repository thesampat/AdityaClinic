what is Black Discoloration on Face?

Black discoloration on the face refers to those dark spots or patches you might notice on your skin. These spots can vary in size and color, from light brown to almost black. They happen because your skin produces too much melanin, which gives it color. Things like being in the sun a lot, hormonal changes (like during pregnancy or due to certain medicines), skin injuries, inflammation, or even genetics can make these dark patches appear.

It's important to know that this kind of discoloration can happen to anyone, no matter what your skin is like or how old you are. These spots can bother a lot of people and make them feel less confident, so many look for ways to get a more even skin tone.
