What is OCD?

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where people have persistent thoughts or fears (obsessions) that lead them to do repetitive actions (compulsions). These thoughts and behaviors can really disrupt their daily lives and cause a lot of stress.

For example, someone with OCD might have a fear of germs, so they feel the need to wash their hands over and over again. Or they might have thoughts about bad things happening if they don't do things in a specific way, like arranging objects a certain way.

It's important to understand that OCD is more than just wanting things neat or clean; it's a serious condition that affects how someone's brain works. Treatment usually involves therapy to learn how to manage these thoughts and behaviors, along with medication to help with anxiety and other symptoms. With the right support, people with OCD can improve their quality of life and feel better.
