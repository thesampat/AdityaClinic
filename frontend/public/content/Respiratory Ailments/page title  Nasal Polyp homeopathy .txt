what is Nasal Polyp?

A nasal polyp is like a small, soft growth that can pop up inside your nose or sinuses. It's usually harmless, feeling squishy like a jellybean or a small grape. These growths come in different sizesâ€”some are so tiny you hardly notice them, while larger ones can cause problems like stuffy noses, runny noses, or even affect your ability to smell properly. They form when the lining of your nose or sinuses gets irritated or inflamed, often due to allergies, infections, or irritants in the air. Most of the time, they're not a big issue, but larger polyps may need medical attention to help you breathe easier.
