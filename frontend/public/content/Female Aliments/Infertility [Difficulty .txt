What is Infertility [Difficulty in Pregnancy]?

Having trouble getting pregnant, known as infertility, can affect couples who've been trying for about a year (if under 35) or six months (if over 35). It's a common issue that can impact both men and women.

For women, causes can include problems with ovulation, issues in the uterus or fallopian tubes, hormonal imbalances, or conditions like endometriosis. Men might have low sperm count or quality, blockages in their reproductive system, or hormone-related problems.

Dealing with infertility can be emotionally challenging, but there are helpful medical treatments available. These may include medications to aid ovulation, surgeries to correct physical issues, or advanced methods like in vitro fertilization (IVF).

Lifestyle habits are also important. Keeping a healthy weight, avoiding smoking and excessive drinking, managing stress, and eating well can improve fertility for both partners.

It's crucial for couples facing infertility to seek help from fertility specialists. They can do tests, pinpoint the problem accurately, and recommend the best treatments tailored to each couple's unique needs. With support and the right advice, many couples can fulfill their dream of having a baby.
