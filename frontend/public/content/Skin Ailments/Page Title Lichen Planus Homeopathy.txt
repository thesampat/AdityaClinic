What is Lichen Planus?

Lichen Planus is a skin condition that can also affect mucous membranes and nails. It shows up as itchy, flat-topped bumps on the skin, often with a purplish color, or as white patches in the mouth. These bumps can be uncomfortable and may cause itching or pain.

While the exact cause of Lichen Planus isn't fully understood, it's believed to involve an abnormal immune response. Triggers like stress, certain medications, or infections might contribute to its development.

This condition isn't contagious or life-threatening, but it can be persistent and bothersome. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, reducing inflammation, and providing relief from itching or discomfort.
