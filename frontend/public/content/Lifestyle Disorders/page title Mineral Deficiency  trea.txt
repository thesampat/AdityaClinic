what is Mineral Deficiency?

Mineral deficiency happens when our bodies don't get enough essential minerals they need to work properly. These minerals, like calcium, iron, and potassium, do important jobs like keeping our bones strong, helping our immune system stay strong, controlling our blood pressure, and making sure our nerves work right.

If we don't eat enough foods with these minerals, it can cause health problems. For example, not getting enough calcium can make our bones weak, not enough iron can make us feel tired and cause anemia, and low potassium can affect our heart health. Eating a balanced diet with foods rich in minerals such as fruits, veggies, nuts, and dairy products is crucial to stay healthy and avoid these issues.
