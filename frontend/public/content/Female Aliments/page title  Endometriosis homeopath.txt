What is Endometriosis?


Endometriosis is when tissue similar to the uterus lining grows outside the uterus. Normally, this tissue sheds during periods, but with endometriosis, it causes inflammation, pain, and sometimes fertility issues because it can't leave the body.

This extra tissue can be found on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or other parts in the pelvis. It leads to discomfort during periods, ongoing pelvic pain, pain during sex, and in severe cases, problems with bowel movements or urination.

Endometriosis affects millions of women globally and can really impact daily life. Doctors diagnose it based on symptoms, exams, ultrasounds, or sometimes a surgery called laparoscopy.

Managing endometriosis involves different methods like pain relief with medications, using hormones to regulate periods, or surgery to remove abnormal tissue. Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, eating well, and handling stress can also help ease symptoms.

For those hoping to get pregnant, working with experts in reproductive health is crucial due to endometriosis potentially affecting fertility. With the right care and support, people with endometriosis can lead fulfilling lives and manage their symptoms well.
