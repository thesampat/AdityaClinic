what is Asthma (Children & Adults)?

Asthma is a bit like having a sensitive set of lungs. When you encounter certain triggers like pollen, dust, or even strong scents, your lungs react by getting inflamed and tight, which can make breathing feel tough. This can lead to wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and feeling like you can't catch your breath. Picture your lungs as tubes that sometimes overreact, causing these uncomfortable symptoms. With proper care, like avoiding triggers and using prescribed medications, many people with asthma can live active lives and manage their symptoms effectively, keeping those breathing difficulties in check.
