what is Sinusitis?

Sinusitis is like a traffic jam in your nose! It happens when the air-filled cavities in your face, called sinuses, become inflamed and congested. This inflammation can be due to various reasons like viruses, bacteria, or allergies, which hinder the normal drainage of these spaces. When the sinuses are blocked, mucus accumulates, leading to symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, facial pressure or pain, headaches, and sometimes a mild fever. Sinusitis can occur suddenly (acute) or persist for a longer duration (chronic), causing discomfort and difficulty breathing until it resolves.
