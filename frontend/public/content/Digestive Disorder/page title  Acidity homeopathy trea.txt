what is Acidity?

Acidity is a common digestive issue where stomach acid flows back into the food pipe, causing discomfort and burning sensations. It often leads to symptoms like heartburn, indigestion, and a sour taste in the mouth. This condition can occur due to various factors like spicy foods, stress, irregular eating habits, or certain medications. Acidity can be uncomfortable and may affect daily activities, but it's manageable with lifestyle changes, diet modifications, and sometimes medications. Seeking medical advice, including homeopathic treatment, can help alleviate symptoms and improve overall digestive health.
