what is Warts ?

Warts are those tiny bumps or flat spots that pop up on our skin or even inside our mouths. They're caused by a virus called HPV, which is quite common. Warts can show up anywhere, like on our hands, feet, or face, and they come in different shapes and sizes.

This virus tricks our skin into growing these little bumps, which can be a bit annoying or embarrassing, especially if they're in plain sight. Warts are contagious, so you can get them from touching someone else's wart or from things like towels or surfaces that have the virus on them.

Usually, warts vanish on their own after some time, but sometimes they stick around and need a little help to go away. That's where homeopathy comes inâ€”it gently nudges our body's defenses to fight off the virus and shrink those warts. Homeopathic treatments are safe, don't involve surgery or anything scary, and are tailored to your specific needs, which makes them a great choice for getting rid of warts.
