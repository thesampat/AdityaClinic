what is Cough / Cold?

Coughs and colds are like uninvited guests that often show up in our lives. When you catch a cold, it typically starts with a scratchy throat, a runny or blocked nose, lots of sneezing, and sometimes a slight rise in body temperature. These pesky bugs are usually spread through the air or by touching things that have been touched by someone with a cold.

Now, let's talk about coughs. They can be caused by all sorts of things like infections, allergies, things that irritate your throat, or even when the air around you is too dry. Coughs can be dry and tickly, or they can be productive, meaning you cough up mucus. It's your body's way of trying to clear things out of your airways.

Thankfully, most coughs and colds don't overstay their welcome. They tend to pack their bags and leave within a week or so. But boy, can they make life miserable while they're around! Getting some rest, drinking lots of fluids, and using remedies to soothe your symptoms can go a long way in making you feel better.
