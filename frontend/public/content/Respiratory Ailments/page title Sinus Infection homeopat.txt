what is Sinus Infection?

A sinus infection, also known as sinusitis, is like a traffic jam in your head! It happens when the spaces in your skull called sinuses get swollen or infected. This can be due to viruses, bacteria, or allergies. When your sinuses are inflamed, they make more mucus, leading to congestion and pressure in your face, around your eyes, nose, and forehead. You might experience a stuffed or runny nose, headache, facial pain, and sometimes coughing. Sinus infections can vary from mild, lasting a few days, to chronic, lasting weeks or months, affecting your breathing and overall comfort.
