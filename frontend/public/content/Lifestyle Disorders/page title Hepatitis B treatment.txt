page title: Hepatitis B treatment?

what is Hepatitis B?

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver. It spreads through contact with infected blood, body fluids, or from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. The virus can cause inflammation in the liver, leading to various symptoms such as fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), nausea, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, liver damage or liver cancer.

It's important to get tested if you suspect you've been exposed to the virus, as early detection can help manage the infection and prevent complications. Vaccination is also available to prevent Hepatitis B infection.
