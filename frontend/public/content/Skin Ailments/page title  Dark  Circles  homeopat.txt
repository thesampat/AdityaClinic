What are Dark Circles?

Dark circles are those pesky shadows under our eyes that make us look tired or older than we are. They often come with puffiness or swelling, making the area under our eyes appear darker and more noticeable.

Many things can lead to dark circles. Not getting enough sleep is a big one because it affects our blood flow and can make the blood vessels under our eyes show more. Feeling tired, stressed, or having a busy life can also make dark circles worse because they can affect our skin health and overall well-being.

Other reasons for dark circles include allergies that make us rub our eyes, too much sun exposure that boosts melanin (the pigment that colors our skin), genetics (sometimes dark circles run in families), and aging, which can thin the skin around our eyes and make dark circles stand out more.

While dark circles aren't usually a big health issue, they can bother us and affect how we feel about our appearance. Managing dark circles involves improving our sleep, reducing stress, handling allergies, protecting our skin from the sun, and using skincare products that target dark circles and puffiness. Homeopathy offers a natural way to deal with dark circles by considering our unique situation and promoting healthy skin overall, giving us brighter and refreshed eyes.
