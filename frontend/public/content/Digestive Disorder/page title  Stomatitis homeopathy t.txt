what is Stomatitis?

Stomatitis is when the inside of your mouth, like your gums or the lining of your cheeks, gets inflamed or irritated. This can lead to discomfort, pain, and sometimes sores or ulcers. It can happen because of different reasons like infections, allergies, or even certain medications. Basically, it's like your mouth's way of telling you that something's not quite right in there and needs some attention. It's common but can be quite bothersome, affecting things like eating and talking until it's treated and starts feeling better.
