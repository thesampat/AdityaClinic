what is Alopecia Areata ?

Alopecia Areata is when your immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, causing hair loss in small, round patches on your scalp or body. It can happen to anyone, regardless of age or gender. We're not entirely sure why it occurs, but it could be due to genetics, immune system issues, or environmental factors.

It's not something contagious or a serious health problem, but it can be tough for those going through it. Hair often grows back within a year, but some might have ongoing issues. Homeopathy and other treatments aim to help your immune system get back in balance and support natural hair regrowth.
