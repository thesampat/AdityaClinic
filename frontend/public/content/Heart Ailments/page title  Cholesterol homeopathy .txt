what is Cholesterol?

Cholesterol is like a building block for our bodies, a type of fat that's crucial for our cells to function properly. It's carried through our bloodstream in tiny packages called lipoproteins. We have "good" cholesterol (HDL) that helps remove excess cholesterol from our blood, and "bad" cholesterol (LDL) that can build up in our arteries and cause problems. When we have too much LDL cholesterol or not enough HDL cholesterol, it can lead to heart disease and stroke. Keeping cholesterol levels balanced by eating healthy and staying active is important for overall health.
