page title: Jaundice homeopathy treatment?

what is Jaundice?

Jaundice is a condition that makes your skin and the whites of your eyes turn yellow. It happens when there's too much bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance produced when red blood cells break down. Normally, your liver processes bilirubin and removes it from your body. But when something goes wrong, like liver issues or excess red blood cell breakdown, bilirubin can build up, causing jaundice. Besides the yellowing, jaundice might make you feel tired, have stomach problems, or your urine might turn dark. It's essential to address jaundice as it can indicate underlying health concerns.
